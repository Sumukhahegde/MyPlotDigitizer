# MyPlotDigitizer

MyPlotDigitizer is a OpenCV-Python based plot digitizer. I wrote this simple program to make it easier to quickly digitize data from the 2D plots. 


### Installation

MyPlotDigitizer requires Opencv-python to run.

Install the dependencies like.

```sh
$ pip install opencv-python
```

Run the program like.
